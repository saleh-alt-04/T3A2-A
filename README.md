The User's Web Browser represents the client-side where users visit the web app. It transmits and receives HTTP requests from the web server.

The Web Server processes HTTP requests from the user's web browser and delivers back the appropriate replies. It serves as a bridge between the client and the application server.

The business logic, API endpoints, application functionality, and data processing are all handled by the Application Server. It takes web server requests, processes them, interacts with the database, and returns results to the web server.
The Database component, such as MongoDB, is responsible for storing and retrieving data required by the application. It manages data persistence and provides a way for interacting with the data that has been saved.
